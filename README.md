# GuessTheAnimal
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sinisterstuf/GuessTheAnimal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sinisterstuf/GuessTheAnimal)

An android game demonstrating a simple AI which learns to guess animals.

This little project is my excuse to practise writing Android applications. The idea is simple enough. It's not a game as such, but rather an app that lets you train a very simple AI to guess animals by asking direct questions, like in the game "[20 questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions)".

So far I have activities for asking questions and learning, which have been translated to several languages. It will learn animals but doesn't save them to file yet, so if you close the application, its knowledge will likely be lost. I'll probably add more as I try out Android features and try out refactoring with TDD in Java.
